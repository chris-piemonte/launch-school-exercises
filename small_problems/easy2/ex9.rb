=begin
In the first example, name is pointing to the address in memor containing 'Bob'. Then save_name is assigned to name, which makes it point at the same address memory, 'Bob'.
Then name is assigned to a new name/address in memory so they are pointing to different addressed ans names now.

In the second example after both variables are pointing to the same address in memory, the naem variable mutates the caller which mutates the address in memory so both 
variables are still pointing to the same address/name.
