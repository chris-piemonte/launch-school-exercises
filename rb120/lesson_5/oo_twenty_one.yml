rules_intro: |
  There is one deck of playing cards used each round and the goal of the game
  is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. You and the dealer
  both start with 2 cards, you can see both of yours but only one of the
  dealer's cards.

  Press enter to continue.
card_values: |
  The card values are as follows:
  - Cards 2 - 10 are worth their face value.
  - Jack, queen, and king are all worth 10.
  - Aces are worth 11 unless it would cause the player to go over 21 (a bust),
    then they are worth 1.

  Press enter to continue.
player_turn: |
  You will go first, you can 'hit' (take an additional card) as many times as
  you want. To win, you must have a higher score than the dealer does after
  their turn without busting (going over 21). When you stay, your turn is over
  and your score is final.

  Press enter to continue.
dealer_turn: |
  On the dealers turn both of their cards are revealed. They must hit until
  they have a 17 or higher. Like the player, if they bust they lose. If it is a
  tie, that is called a 'push' and no one wins.

  Press enter to continue.
winning: |
  As there is no money to play with, the player that wins a round scores a
  point. First to 3 points is the champion, but you can also exit the game
  after any round. Let's begin!

  Press enter to start the game.
