  >> Press any key to continue.
card_explanation: |
  >> You and the dealer both start with 2 cards, you can see both of yours
  >> but only one of the dealer's. If you or the dealer starts with a
  >> blackjack (a score of 21 from an Ace and a ten) they automatically win
  >> the round. The card values are as follows:
  >> - Cards 2 - 10 are worth their face value.
  >> - Jack, queen, and king are all worth 10.
  >> - Aces are worth 11 unless it would cause the player to go over 21
       (a bust), then it is worth 1.
  >> Press any key to continue.
player_turn_rules: |
  >> You will go first, you can 'hit' (take an additional card) as many times
  >> as you want. To win, you must have a higher score than the dealer does
  >> after their turn without busting (going over 21). When you stay, your
  >> turn is over and your score is final.
  >> Press any key to continue.
dealer_turn_rules: |
  >> On the dealers turn both of their cards are revealed. They must hit
  >> until they have a 17 or higher. Like the player, if they bust they
  >> lose. If it is a tie, that is called a 'push' and no one wins.
  >> Press any key to start the game.
